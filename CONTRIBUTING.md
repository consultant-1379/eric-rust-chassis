## Contribution Workflow
1. The **contributor** updates the artifact in the local repository.
2. The **contributor** pushes the update to Gerrit for review, including a reference to the JIRA.
3. The **contributor** invites the **service guardians** (mandatory) and **other relevant parties** (optional) to the Gerrit review, and makes no further changes to the document until it is reviewed.
4. The **service guardians** review the document and give a code-review score.
The code-review scores and corresponding workflow activities are as follows:
    - Score is +1
        A **reviewer** is happy with the changes but approval is required from another reviewer.
    - Score is +2
        The **service guardian** accepts the change and merges the code to master branch. The Publish pipeline is initiated to make the change available to consumers.
    - Score is -1 or -2
        The **contributor** follows-up on reviewer comments, until changes approved by service guardian.
    - The **service guardian** and the **contributor** align to determine when and how the change is published.
